    // Backstory
    backstoryHeader: "The gruepr backstory",
    backstoryText: `As an educator, I want my students to have the best possible experience during group work. 
      I created gruepr because I was spending too much time assembling teams that accounted for my students' 
      individual schedules and past experiences. I wanted a tool that could help me, and I wanted to keep it always 
      free and open source for my fellow educators. The first version of the app was named "grouper," and that 
      inspired my scuba-diving colleage to give me a fish logo. The name later changed to "gruepr" because the challenges 
      of developing my first app reminded me of trying to avoid the fictional monster 
      that haunts the dark in the first computer game I remember ever playing.`,
